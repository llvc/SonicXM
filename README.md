<H5>Description</h5>
It is a music player that can play music stored in many different places, including music subscription services, promotion platforms, networked libraries, online data lockers, and more. It does this by decoupling the name of the song from the source it was shared from (e.g. a friend's playlist) and fulfills the "play" request using all available sources. This allows Tomahawk users to create playlists using songs from their own computer, Spotify, YouTube, and more. The Toma.hk API uses Tomahawk's technology to allow users to embed a player for almost any song on a website using JavaScript.
